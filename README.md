## Data Cleaning and Interactive Dashboard in Excel 

Excel is a powerful tool for data explorations. In this project, I use Excel Online to analyze a dataset containing demographic information of bike users and non-users.

1) Cleaning the raw data by eliminating duplicates, checking for faulty entries with filters and using formulas to standardize cells.
2) Creating Pivot Tables to review specific demographic information.
3) Inserting charts that best represent the varibles in the Pivot Tables.
4) Making an interactive dashboard with slicers that modifies the charts based on custom selections.
